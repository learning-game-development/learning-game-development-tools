## Pixel Art Tips

- Start with 8x8 or 16x16 canvas before going bigger.

### Structure

1. Silhouette of a solid colour
2. Blockout the general shape of the object
3. Colour, shading and details

### Colour

You have a base colour, a shadow and a highlight of that colour.

### Shadow

Decrease the `value` and `saturation`, then shift the `hue` closer to blue.

### Highlight

Note: _Oppisite of shadow_

Increase the `value` and `saturation`, then shift the `hue` closer to yellow for solid objects.

OR

Increase the `value` and _decrease_ `saturation`, then shift the `hue` closer to yellow for transparent objects.

## Pixel Art Rules

- Use the 2:1 Ratio for perfect isometric tiling
